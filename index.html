    <p><b>[Carter and Lee hit the Vegas branch of Versace where a salesman greets them]</b></p>
    <p><span data-actor="salesman">Salesman: Hi, nice to see you. Can I help you gentlemen?</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="carter">Carter: Yeah. I'm gonna need black, 42-long, and nothing touches this body but pure silk. And get my partner something from the kid's department.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="salesman">Salesman: OK, would your partner like to be wrapped in silk too? Some people think it's tacky, but I really enjoy it when couples dress alike.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="carter">Carter: No - wait a minute - no! This ain't no couples thing, man. We're police officers; we're working a very dangerous case and we need some clothes.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="lee">Lee: Yes, there are alot of men chasing us.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="salesman">Salesman: As well they should be. Listen, you have nothing to worry about, OK? Because I'm going to turn you two into the belle of the ball.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="lee">Lee: Thank you.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="salesman">Salesman: Absolutely. [to Carter] Let's start with you, shall we? You've got the mochaccino face, beautiful skin, and the big broad shoulders, OK? Let's put a dead animal on you! Croc-skin... buttercream... buttercream... croc-skin... buttercream...What size is the waist? Let's go in! [approaches Carter with open arms]</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="carter">Carter: Hey! Watch it, sweetness!</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="salesman">Salesman: He's got some fire to him!</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="carter">Carter: Honeycups!</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="salesman">Salesman: I like that!</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="carter">Carter: Go get the clothes! Hurry up!</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="salesman">Salesman: I'll go pull some items. Oh, Jesus! Lil' Kim! I'll be back.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="carter">Carter: [Looks to Lee] You saw that?</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="lee">Lee: He likes you.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="carter">Carter: [Looks at him like he's lost his mind] I'm not shoppin' with you no more.</span></p>
